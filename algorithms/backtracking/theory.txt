lets say we have a string "abc"
now we know then number of permutations is 3! = 6 right ?


--> swap the first element with first then second and then with third and then pass it to the recursive call;
--> now the first element is fixed so start doing the previous step with the second element 
--> the there will be only one element left then we will print the solution and return this is the base case
