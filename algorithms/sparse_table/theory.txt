range queries can be --> 1. sum of values in a range 
                         2. max or min value in a range
                         
possible solutions can be --> bruteforce (O(n*q)) 
                          --> segment tree/fenwick tree (nlogn + qlogn) 
                          --> sparse table (nlogn + q)
                          
sparse table solution:

what is sparse table ?
sparse table is a pre computation table for answering queries 

its a two dimensional array 

sparse_table[i][j] gives the value of a segment starting from index i and len of 2^j which means it gives the query for segment i to i+2^j-1;


now a thing is that if we want to find the query of segment from x to y suppose 

then here len is (y-x+1) so it means it will be from sparse table at index 
[x][len]

now the thing is if we want to calculate the value of segment starting from x and of length len that means its equal to 

segment1 = starting at index x of length len/2 +
segment2 = starting at index x+(len/2) of length len/2 right ?

thats how we answer queries with the sparse table
